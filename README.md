# nvim config

I use [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with some tweaks to suit my needs.

## Installation

This is a submodule of my dotfiles, information on installation can be found [in that repository](https://github.com/yangavin/.dotfiles)

## Custom branch

Before LazyVim, I also have my own neovim configuration. You can find it in the `custom` branch.
